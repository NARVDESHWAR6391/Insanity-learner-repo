    <h3>1.Explained:In criticism & lawsuit,debate over coding for kids</h3>
    <b>(i) Why is learning to code a big deal ?</b>
    <p>At the turm of this century,when extremely afforable computer made their way in to technical and engineering
        college across the country,India was able to produce a huge army of coder and programmer-essentially people who 
        could create computer software.As computing devise have taken over every aspect of life,the need for good 
        programmers and coders has been increase relentlessly-and calls to teach coding and programming to young students 
        have got louder years, plateforms and companies have started to claim that kids as young as those in elementry
        school must begin to learn coding
    </p>
    <b>(ii) How did the call to stsrt teaching code to children in elementry school come about?</b>
    <p>Since the advent of computer and arrival of computer coding as the next big thing,leader of technology computer
        around the world have pushed for coding to be included as a subject in middle or higher secondary school for 
        students who may be intrested to learn. In 2018, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wrote in a bloge post that
        everyone could benefit from learning the basics of computer science. According to Gates,coding,which,he taught
        himself and fell in love with at the age of 13,led him to ask quistion about how to achieve task,and find answer 
        to quistion."The quistion it teacher you to ask - How do you accomplish a task? Can you find a pattern ? What
        data do you need ? - are useful no matter where you go in life,"Gate wrote.
    </p>]
     <b>(iv) What do the critics - learning at an early age say?</b>
    <p>The primary contention against learning to code at a very young age is that some age group, which are being 
        targeted  by plateforms,are being pushed into it even before they have mastered the mathmatical and 
        technological fundamentals. A metaphor that is often is that children are being made to ride a bicycle before they
        have even learnt to walk. Software engineering Pradeep Poonia,30,a vocal critic who has become a prominent voice 
        in the debate,says: "threr's a reason why in mathematics addition is tought first, then substraction,then
        multiplication,and then division.It necessary to learn several element of mathematics and logical thinking
        before we can code [What many of the online platforms are doing these days] is like someone teaching you to draw
        a car under the pretext of making you learn how to build a car."
